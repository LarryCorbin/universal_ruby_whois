Universal Whois Server
============================
Author: Matt Lightner <mlightner@gmail.com>

This library attempts to interpret WHOIS output from a variety of different registrars.
The ultimate goal is to have a complete "dictionary" of all of the TLD registrars (including
double domain TLDs such as .co.uk) on the Internet.

This package requires a command line whois utility to retrieve output.  It will then attempt
to interpret that output based on a series of regular expressions.


== DEFINING WHOIS SERVERS ==

Whois servers can be defined on a per-extension basis, so each registrar can have a unique set
of regular expressions to match its particular output format.  Whois servers are defined in the
file server_list.rb.

If you're using this module and come across a TLD that isn't yet supported or isn't working
quite right, I highly encourage you to fork the project and commit your updates.  The more
people we have working on the list, the more comprehensive and effective it becomes!

== EXAMPLE USAGE ==

Here is the output from a sample IRB session using this module:

> require 'universal_ruby_whois'
=> true

> domain = Whois.find("mattlightner.com")
=> #<Whois::Domain:0xb7a3b014 @domain="mattlightner.com", @server_tld_key="com">

> domain.status
=> :registered

> domain.available?
=> false

> domain.registered?
=> true

> domain.created_date
=> Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 EDT 2006

> domain = Whois.find("9384jf398ejf9832ej.com")            
=> #<Whois::Domain:0xb7a1ab34 @domain="9384jf398ejf9832ej.com", @server_tld_key="com">

> domain.status      
=> :free


== NOTES ==

Some registrars are relatively unreliable or may add a server to a blacklist after a certain number of
queries.  In particular, the registrars for these domains:

 - es and related TLDs.  They only provide an HTTP whois access interface, which is unreliable at best
   (although this module supports HTTP lookups quite well).

 - asn.au com.au id.au net.au org.au, 'whois.aunic.net', seems as though they will blacklist a server
   making too many queries.  Not sure about their blacklist removal policy.
